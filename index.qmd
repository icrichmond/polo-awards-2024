## Argument 1: courtside cheering

Sasha is ALWAYS bringing the most positive, fun, upbeat courtside energy!!! No matter who you are, Sasha is happy to see you, cheering you on, and looking good doing it!

## Argument 2: showing up !! 

Feeling shy? Discouraged? Lonely? JOIN RAD POLO, so that you can have a friend that you know will show up, watch your pickup games, dress up for Halloween with you, and welcome you into a community (that friend is Sasha)

## Argument 3: manners 

All good sweethearts need manners, and Sasha always tells you he is going to kill you before he does!! How polite.
